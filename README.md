Implementation and simulation of strategies for Iterative Prisoner's Dilemma

The Prisoner's Dilemma (PD) is a classical game analyzed in game theory, which is widely used to (attempt to) model social/economical interaction. It's a "dilemma" as, if exploited to explain the emergence of altruism in human or in general animal society, it fails badly at a first glance.

The classical situation-representation of the PD is that of two prisoners whose conviction depends on their mutual cooperation. It is easier understood though if illustrated in terms of a trade-off game (closed bag exachange):

Two people meet and exchange closed bags, with the understanding that one of them contains money, and the other contains a purchase. Either player can choose to honor the deal by putting into his or her bag what he or she agreed, or he or she can defect by handing over an empty bag.

It is obvious that for both players the winning strategy is to NOT cooperate.

Things changes when the interaction between the two individuals is iterated, in that case a more altruist attitude (strategy) is expected to emerge. The goal of this project is to test this hypothesis.
